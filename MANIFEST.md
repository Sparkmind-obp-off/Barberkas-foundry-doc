## 3. Aturan manifest

1. Setiap file `.md` baru di `canonical/` wajib terdaftar di §2 pada commit yang sama.
2. Perubahan status lifecycle wajib tercermin di kolom Status.
3. Validator ([tools/](canonical/99-schema/990-document-schema.md)) memverifikasi:
   file tanpa entri manifest = **orphan → error**; entri tanpa file = **dangling → error**.

## Version history

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 3.0.0 | 2026-07-10 | Dokumen baru — Hardening Phase 1: registry penuh 45 dokumen + 15 folder |
